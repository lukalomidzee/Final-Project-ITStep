# Calculator Application

This project is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Project Structure

- **`Program.cs`**: Contains the main functionality of the calculator.

## Features

1. Four basic arithmetic operations are supported:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)

   These operations are mapped to the numbers on the keyboard (1, 2, 3, 4) using a dictionary for easy selection.

2. At the start of the program, an instance of the `Calculator` class is created to use its functions.

3. The calculator performs operations based on the chosen function. The user provides two numbers as input for the operation.

4. A `do-while` loop is used to repeatedly ask for the next operation until the user presses the 'Enter' key to exit.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. Select an operation by pressing the corresponding number key (1, 2, 3, or 4).
3. Enter the first and second numbers for the operation.
4. View the result and choose whether to perform another operation.
5. Press 'Enter' to exit the program.
